# Meta-Media-Search

## Vision

Pioneer the world's first AI-native discovery map for media, empowering users to instantly surface the best content options through natural, intuitive prompts and viewing preferences.

## The Problem

Every night, millions spend up to 30 minutes deciding what to watch — billions of hours lost per day. Not from lack of content, but from fragmentation across streaming platforms.

## The Solution

A modern reinterpretation of Kartoo.fr/com's visual search interface, reimagined for media discovery in the AI era. An interactive visual map that:

- Understands natural language queries ("funny sci-fi movies like The Martian")
- Visualizes content relationships and recommendations as an interactive map
- Aggregates across all streaming platforms
- Learns from your preferences to improve over time
- Makes discovery instant and delightful

## Inspiration: Kartoo

Kartoo was a revolutionary visual search engine (2001-2010) that displayed search results as an interactive map of related concepts. We're bringing that visual magic to media discovery.

## Key Features

### 1. AI-Native Query Processing

- Natural language understanding
- Intent detection and query refinement
- Semantic search across media metadata

### 2. Visual Discovery Map

- Interactive node-based visualization
- Content clustering by similarity
- Zoom/pan navigation
- Smooth animations and transitions

### 3. Multi-Platform Aggregation

- Netflix, Hulu, Disney+, Amazon Prime, HBO, etc.
- Unified search across all platforms
- Direct "watch now" links

### 4. Personalized Recommendations

- Learn from viewing history
- Preference-based filtering
- Mood and context-aware suggestions

## Technology Stack

### Frontend

- React + TypeScript
- D3.js/Three.js for visualization
- Vite for build tooling
- Responsive design for mobile/desktop

### Backend

- Node.js + Express
- TypeScript
- GraphQL API
- PostgreSQL + Vector DB

### AI/ML

- LangChain/OpenAI for NLP
- Vector embeddings for semantic search
- Recommendation algorithms

### Infrastructure

- Redis caching
- Docker containerization
- CI/CD with GitHub Actions

## Development Methodology

Following rUv's agentic engineering practices:

- **SPARC**: Specification → Pseudocode → Architecture → Refinement → Completion
- **Agentic Flow**: Multi-agent orchestration for parallel development
- **AgentDB**: Knowledge persistence across agents
- **TDD**: Test-driven development
